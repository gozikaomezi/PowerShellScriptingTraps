# MySystemStatus

This is a demonstration module with a few commands to get system information from one or more remote computers. The commands should be considered incomplete as they lack any type of error handling.

Help files are also incomplete and were begun using commands from the [Platyps](https://github.com/powershell/platyps) module.

All code and files in this module should be considered educational.
